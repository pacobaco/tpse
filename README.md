# Treasury Search with Flask & Elasticsearch

This is a Flask-based application that allows searching and indexing of treasury-related data using Elasticsearch. The app enables users to perform full-text searches on document content while applying filters based on specific fields such as `treasury_id`, `census_block`, and `isp`.

## Features

- **Indexing of treasury documents**: Data including treasury identifiers, domain names, IP addresses, content, census block, ISP, and employee tree information can be indexed.
- **Search functionality**: Allows querying of documents based on free-text search and filters.
- **ElasticSearch integration**: Built on Elasticsearch for full-text searching, aggregation, and filtering capabilities.
- **Flexible search filters**: Supports filtering search results by `treasury_id`, `census_block`, and `isp`.

## Prerequisites

- **Elasticsearch**: You need to have Elasticsearch installed and running on `http://localhost:9200` (or update the `Elasticsearch` URL in the code to match your setup).
- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/treasury-search.git
   cd treasury-search
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **requirements.txt** should include:
   ```
   Flask==2.2.2
   elasticsearch==8.3.0
   ```

3. Ensure Elasticsearch is running:
   - If you don't have Elasticsearch installed, you can follow the installation guide [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html).
   - Start the Elasticsearch service:
     ```bash
     sudo service elasticsearch start
     ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Indexing Data

To index a document (e.g., treasury data) into Elasticsearch, you can use the `index_document()` function. Here’s an example of how to use it programmatically:

```python
index_document(
    treasury_id="12345",
    domain="example.com",
    ip_address="192.168.1.1",
    content="This is a sample treasury document content.",
    census_block="1234567890",
    isp="ISP_Name",
    employee_tree=[{
        "parent_id": "001",
        "employee_id": "E123",
        "position": "Manager"
    }]
)
```

### Searching Data

You can search for documents by sending a `GET` request to the `/search` endpoint with the following query parameters:

- `q`: The search query (free-text search within `content`).
- `treasury_id`: Filter by treasury identifier.
- `census_block`: Filter by census block.
- `isp`: Filter by ISP.

Example search query:
```bash
http://localhost:5000/search?q=donation&treasury_id=12345&census_block=1234567890&isp=ISP_Name
```

This will return the matching documents based on the provided query and filters.

## API Endpoints

### `GET /search`

#### Parameters:

- `q` (required): Search query for the content of the documents.
- `treasury_id` (optional): Filter results by specific treasury ID.
- `census_block` (optional): Filter results by census block.
- `isp` (optional): Filter results by ISP.

#### Response:

Returns a JSON array of matching documents with their metadata and content.

Example Response:
```json
[
    {
        "_index": "treasury_search",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 1.0,
        "_source": {
            "treasury_id": "12345",
            "domain": "example.com",
            "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
            "content": "This is a sample treasury document content.",
            "census_block": "1234567890",
            "isp": "ISP_Name",
            "employee_tree": [{
                "parent_id": "001",
                "employee_id": "E123",
                "position": "Manager"
            }]
        }
    }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

- If Elasticsearch isn't running, ensure it’s installed and started.
- If you're seeing issues with the Elasticsearch version, check that your version of `elasticsearch-py` is compatible with your Elasticsearch server version.
- If Flask isn't loading or serving, make sure the required Python packages are installed correctly.
